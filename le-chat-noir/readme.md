## Introduction

This projects helped (is helping) me on studying **RxJS** and **redux-observable**.  
It's a client server websocket web chat.  
You can launch server and client and open multiple browser to try ho it works.

**NOTE**: EVERYTHING IS STILL IN PROGRESS... actually it kind of does work, but it sucks a lot. I'm still trying to get into rxjs and redux-observable epics mechanism.
